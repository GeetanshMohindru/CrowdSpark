## üìÅ Included Files and Summary of Changes

### Backend (API):

1.  `api/server.js`:
    *   **Real-time Notifications**: Integrated Socket.IO for real-time communication. Added `io.on("connection")` to handle client connections and `socket.on("join")` to allow users to join personal rooms for targeted notifications. Implemented a `createNotification` helper function to save and emit notifications.
    *   **Notification Endpoints**: Added new API routes for fetching user-specific notifications (`/api/notifications/:userId`), marking notifications as read (`/api/notifications/:id/read`), marking all notifications as read for a user (`/api/notifications/user/:userId/read-all`), and fetching all notifications (admin) (`/api/notifications`).
    *   **Route Integration**: Passed `io` and `createNotification` to `campaignRoutes` and `adminRoutes`.

2.  `api/campaign.routes.js`:
    *   **Description Validation**: Modified the `POST /` route for creating campaigns to include a check for a detailed description (minimum 50 characters). If the description is insufficient, it returns an error with `requiresDescription: true` and suggestions.
    *   **Notification Triggers**: Added logic to emit `campaignFunded` and `campaignComment` events via Socket.IO. Also, calls `createNotification` to send notifications to campaign owners for new funding and comments, and to contributors for successful contributions.
    *   **Description Validation Endpoint**: Added a new `POST /validate-description` endpoint to allow frontend to validate campaign descriptions in real-time.

3.  `api/admin.routes.js`:
    *   **Notification Triggers**: Modified `PATCH /campaigns/:id/approve` and `PATCH /campaigns/:id/reject` to send notifications to campaign owners upon approval or rejection. Also emits `campaignApproved` and `campaignRejected` Socket.IO events.
    *   **Admin Notification Endpoints**: Added `POST /notify-user` to send a specific notification to a user and `POST /broadcast` to send a notification to all users.

4.  `api/notification.model.js`:
    *   **Schema Enhancement**: Added a `type` field to the notification schema with an enum (`funding`, `comment`, `admin`, `campaign_approved`, `campaign_rejected`, `info`) to categorize notifications. Also added `campaignId` to link notifications to specific campaigns.

### Frontend (React):

1.  `src/App.jsx`:
    *   **Socket.IO Integration**: Initialized Socket.IO client and set up listeners for `campaignFunded`, `campaignComment`, `campaignApproved`, `campaignRejected`, `notification`, and `broadcast` events to update UI and display toasts.
    *   **Notification State**: Added `notifications` and `unreadCount` states to manage and display notifications.
    *   **Description Prompt Logic**: Implemented `descriptionValidation` state and `showDescriptionPrompt` state to control the display of the description validation modal. Added `validateDescription` function to call the backend validation endpoint.
    *   **Campaign Creation Form**: Modified the campaign creation form to include real-time description validation and trigger the description prompt modal if needed.
    *   **Topbar Integration**: Passed `unreadCount` to the `Topbar` component.

2.  `src/pages/Notifications.jsx`:
    *   **Complete Notification UI**: Reworked the component to display a list of notifications with icons, colors, and read/unread status. Includes filtering options (All, Unread, Funding, Comments, Admin).
    *   **Mark as Read Functionality**: Added `markAsRead` and `markAllAsRead` functions to interact with the backend API.
    *   **Real-time Updates**: Integrated Socket.IO client to receive new notifications in real-time and update the list dynamically.

3.  `src/components/ui/topbar.jsx`:
    *   **Notification Badge**: Added a notification icon with an unread count badge, which links to the `/notifications` page.

### Other New Files:

-   `.env.example`: An example environment file for configuring the backend.

## üõ† Usage

To integrate these changes into your existing CrowdSpark project:

1.  **Replace** the corresponding files in your project with the ones provided in this archive.
2.  **Update `package.json`**: Ensure `socket.io-client` is added to your `dependencies` in `package.json`.
3.  **Backend Dependencies**: Install `socket.io` and `nodemon` (for `server:dev` script) in your backend project.
4.  **Environment Variables**: Refer to `.env.example` for necessary environment variables.
5.  **MongoDB**: Ensure your MongoDB instance is running.

After replacing the files and installing dependencies, you can run your project as usual:

```bash
# In your backend directory (e.g., api/)
npm install # if you haven't already
npm run server:dev

# In your frontend directory (e.g., src/)
npm install # if you haven't already
npm run dev
```

This will start both the backend and frontend servers, and the new features will be active. Remember to configure your `.env` file with your MongoDB URI and any other necessary keys.
