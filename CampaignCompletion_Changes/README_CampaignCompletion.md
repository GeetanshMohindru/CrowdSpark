# CrowdSpark - Campaign Completion Notifications

This archive contains the files modified to implement campaign completion notifications in the CrowdSpark project.

## 🎯 New Feature: Campaign Completion Notifications

### What's New:
1. **Individual Campaign Completion**: When a campaign reaches its funding goal, the campaign owner receives a congratulatory notification.
2. **All Campaigns Completion**: When all campaigns on the platform are completed, a special notification is sent to admin users.
3. **Real-time Updates**: Both types of completion notifications are sent in real-time using Socket.IO.

## 📁 Modified Files and Changes

### Backend (API):

1. **`api/campaign.model.js`**:
   - **Added `completed` field**: A boolean field to track whether a campaign has reached its funding goal.
   ```javascript
   completed: { type: Boolean, default: false }
   ```

2. **`api/campaign.routes.js`**:
   - **Campaign Completion Check**: In the `/contribute` endpoint, added logic to check if the campaign goal is met after each contribution.
   - **Completion Notification**: When a campaign reaches its goal, it:
     - Sets `completed: true` in the database
     - Sends a congratulatory notification to the campaign owner
     - Emits a `campaignCompleted` event via Socket.IO
   ```javascript
   // Check if campaign goal is met or exceeded
   if (campaign.fundsRaised >= campaign.goal && !campaign.completed) {
     campaign.completed = true;
     await campaign.save();
     if (campaign.owner) {
       await createNotification(
         campaign.owner._id,
         `Congratulations! Your campaign "${campaign.title}" has reached its funding goal of ₹${campaign.goal}! 🎉`,
         'info',
         campaign._id
       );
     }
     io.emit('campaignCompleted', { campaignId: campaign._id, title: campaign.title });
   }
   ```

3. **`api/server.js`**:
   - **All Campaigns Completion Check**: Added a periodic check (every 5 minutes) to see if all campaigns are completed.
   - **Broadcast Notification**: When all campaigns are completed, sends a notification to admin users and broadcasts to all connected clients.
   ```javascript
   const checkAllCampaignsCompleted = async () => {
     try {
       const totalCampaigns = await Campaign.countDocuments();
       const completedCampaigns = await Campaign.countDocuments({ completed: true });

       if (totalCampaigns > 0 && totalCampaigns === completedCampaigns) {
         // Send notification to admin and broadcast
         const adminUser = await User.findOne({ isAdmin: true });
         if (adminUser) {
           await createNotification(
             adminUser._id,
             'All campaigns on CrowdSpark have been successfully completed! 🎉',
             'info'
           );
           io.emit('allCampaignsCompleted', { message: 'All campaigns on CrowdSpark have been successfully completed! 🎉' });
         }
       }
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error checking all campaigns completion:', error);
     }
   };
   ```

### Frontend (React):

1. **`src/App.jsx`**:
   - **Campaign Completion Listener**: Added Socket.IO listener for `campaignCompleted` events to show toast notifications when individual campaigns are completed.
   - **All Campaigns Completion Listener**: Added Socket.IO listener for `allCampaignsCompleted` events to show special notifications when all campaigns are done.
   ```javascript
   socketRef.current.on('campaignCompleted', ({ campaignId, title }) => {
     setToast(`🎉 Campaign "${title}" has reached its funding goal!`)
     fetchCampaigns()
   })
   
   socketRef.current.on('allCampaignsCompleted', ({ message }) => {
     setToast(message)
   })
   ```

## 🚀 How It Works

### Individual Campaign Completion:
1. When a user contributes to a campaign, the system checks if the total funds raised meet or exceed the goal.
2. If the goal is reached for the first time, the campaign is marked as `completed: true`.
3. The campaign owner receives a notification: "Congratulations! Your campaign [title] has reached its funding goal of ₹[amount]! 🎉"
4. All connected clients receive a real-time update showing the campaign completion.

### All Campaigns Completion:
1. Every 5 minutes, the server checks if all campaigns in the database are completed.
2. If all campaigns are completed, it sends a special notification to admin users.
3. A broadcast message is sent to all connected clients: "All campaigns on CrowdSpark have been successfully completed! 🎉"
4. Duplicate notifications are prevented by checking if the notification already exists.

## 🛠 Integration Instructions

To integrate these changes into your existing CrowdSpark project:

1. **Replace** the corresponding files in your project with the ones provided in this archive.
2. **Database Migration**: The `completed` field will be automatically added to new campaigns. Existing campaigns will have `completed: false` by default.
3. **Admin User**: Ensure you have at least one user with `isAdmin: true` in your User model for the all-campaigns-completion feature to work.

After replacing the files, restart your backend server. The new campaign completion notifications will be active immediately.

## 📋 Testing

To test the campaign completion notifications:

1. **Individual Campaign**: Create a campaign with a small goal (e.g., ₹100) and contribute enough to reach the goal.
2. **All Campaigns**: Complete all campaigns on your platform to trigger the all-campaigns-completion notification.

The notifications will appear as toast messages in the frontend and will also be stored in the notifications system for persistent viewing.
